		<h2> About my life </h2>

		<p>
			I was born in Lyon, France and lived in France until I was 10 : since then, I moved to New-York for 2 years and to Bangalore, India for 3. All my family is French, although I have some italian origins. I love sports as much as chilling, and enjoy good food a lot

		<h2>Here's about what I love</h2>

		<p>

	</p>

	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Eating</h2>
		<p>
			Strangely, going to new places every one and then has made me curious in the culinary domain : now I enjoy eating in american fast foods as much as having a nice tandoori chicken in an Indian restaurant !üòã
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="subdiv">
		<h2>Languages spoken</h2>

		<p>
			I speak French (it's my mother tongue) and English fluently, after living for about 5 years in foreign countries. Since I'm 10, I learn spanish at school, and since I'm at ESSEC, I also learn German.
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Travelling</h2>
		<p>
			During my teenage years, I have lived in France, the United States and India ! I made friends all over the world and discovered amazing places.üåç
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="subdiv">
		<h2>Football</h2>
		<p>
			Whether it's playing or watching football, I don't really care, I just love the sport and find it really distractive. It's also a great experience being such a big fan of one team and being so emotionally attached to it !
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Neftlix</h2>
		<p>
			I love netflix. I mean, there's just so much TV shows or movies to watch that it has become a daily routine to open my laptop and watch 2 to 10 consecutive episodes at once.üôÉ
